      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[Yes it is possible to solve the problem using a single for loop.]</p>
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?]</li>
      <p>[Yes we can create an infinite loop, because a while loop will keep running until it reaches the given condition, and if the given condition is never met it will keep running.]</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[It depends on the computer hardware the code is running on, as well as how complex the program or code is. The more complex, the more time it will take for the computer to compute it.]</p>
      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?]</li>
      <p>[It is possible to reverse the order of the columns, but if you change the order will also affect the output.]</p>
