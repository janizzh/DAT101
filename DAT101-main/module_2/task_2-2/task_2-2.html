      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				Constants are usually used for values that will remain fixed throughout the code. While variables can be used in math operations, manipulation of texts or logical operations.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parentheses affect the arithmetic because it will be computed first before multiplication and division. So when using parentheses the operations inside will be computed first. Which follows the same rule as in traditional mathematics.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals by using the toFixed() method.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We can't compare two floating-point values using the equal to operator (==). This is because in Javascript floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate. 12.99999 is not the same as 12.2 in Javascript. We can test this in the console (Chrome browser) by assigning a = 12.199999 and b = 12.2 and then type a == b. The output will be FALSE. 
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine quality or difference between variables or values. They return TRUE or FALSE answers. We can check if they are TRUE or FALSE simply by looking at the statement thats given.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() function returns a random floating-point number equal to or greater than 0 but less than 1. It can be used to find a random number between two values, get an integer between a minimum and maximum value and etc. 
			</p> 
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				The modulus (%) operator returns the division remainder. It can be used to check for even/odd numbers.
