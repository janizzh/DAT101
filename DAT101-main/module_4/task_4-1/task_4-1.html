      <li>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[It makes the code easier to maintain and is capable of containing lots of data in just one object. Its a way of approaching real world objects]</p>
      <li>[n Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development]</li>
      <p>[The object is used to further solve the next tasks without needing to create a new object every single time. ]</p>
      <li>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>
      <p>[Its important to hide code within the class to protects its data and to make the coding easier and less complex. 
        You can create private and public members in a construction function by using #private command or this command.]</p>
      <li>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>
      <p>[Write your answer here, and copy this for more answers]</p>
