      <li>[What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[An array is a collection of data]</p>
      <li>[What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding")]</li>
      <p>[Hard coding involves writing and using values directly in the code]</p>
      <li>[Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.]</li>
      <p>[By using the .length property humans don't need to worry about the arrays length as .length will adapt to any array]</p>
      <li>[Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4]</li>
      <p>[Because you can put 2 different arrays into one by combining them, making the code easier and less complex]</p>
      <li>[Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look?]</li>
      <p>[Write your answer here, and copy this for more answers]</p>
      <li>[In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.]</li>
      <p>[Write your answer here, and copy this for more answers]</p>
      <li>[What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs]</li>
      <p>[Write your answer here, and copy this for more answers]</p>
      <li>[In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains]</li>
      <p>[Write your answer here, and copy this for more answers]</p>
